Interfacing signal-cli from Python

A collection of very minimalistic Python programs that show how to interface 
signal-cli (https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) from python. 
They require GLib and pydbus (https://github.com/LEW21/pydbus).

signal-cli needs to be started as a system DBus service (see 
https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/DBus-service).
